                <p>
                    I am a passionate and driven designer and developer with 5 years of
                    experience working with game engines such as Unity (2 years) and Unreal Engine (5 years).
                    I am skilled with Unreal Engines blueprint scripting, C++, C#, blockmeshing,
                    animation, sound design, debugging, troubleshooting,
                    lighting, packaging and deploying, as well as publishing to platforms on Steam, Xbox Store and
                    Nintendo eShop.
                    I also have knowledge and skills in IT, Networks, Cybersecurity and Web Development. <br><br>

                    I went to Fresno City College for Computer Information Systems, as well as Full Sail University for
                    Game Design. <br><br>

                    I have also built my own homelab, including a server running an Active Directory for my home,
                    Proxmox as a Hypervisor, with LXC containers
                    for Docker, Portainer, TrueNAS as well as virtual machines for Linux and Windows Server and
                    a private Terraria server. I have also set up a VLAN in my home to isolate my wireless devices, as well as my IoT devices. <br><br>

                    In my free time, I enjoy hiking, reading, fixing computers and other electronic devices, as well
                    as spending time with my cat, Azshara.(Pictured Below)<br>
